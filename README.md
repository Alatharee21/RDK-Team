For AR/VR Africa hackathon

This project is developed with the aim of educating people on Genetic conditions. It will cover simplified explanations on how these conditions are passed on to a child and suggestions on how to avoid.

So the new thought is still in the line of health. We have tried hard to think of a concept where we can justify why we used AR cause it was mentioned during the info session that our choice should be the best approach for the devised solution.

For those who don't know, Augmented Reality is a technology that adds virtual objects to real world objects e.g your Snapchat filters could add puppy ears(virtual object) to your face(real object)

So we thinking of creating a heath app that scans different types of rashes. So it gives details of a type of rash based on the image provided in front of the phone camera. Something like how Google lens works
